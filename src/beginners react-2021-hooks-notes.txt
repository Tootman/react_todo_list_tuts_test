React rules:
 - In React you should never directly alter the state ob. You always create a copy, modify the copy, and then use that copy to set the new state

useful react Hooks:
useRef - allows app to reference elements within the HTML eg value of Input box
useEffect - a function that  takes two functions ist is func that manipulates  - and causes side effects eg saving, 2nd is an array of vars that it is 'watching' for changes
